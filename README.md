My local cafe operates as such: 

At our coffee shop, we sell coffee beans in 1-pound servings, and we get our coffee delivered in large burlap sacks. Here are the details:

* we sell multiple types of coffee beans, each in different burlap sacks
* one burlap sack contains 130 pounds of coffee beans
* every sale decrements one pound of coffee beans from the burlap sack, until it is empty
